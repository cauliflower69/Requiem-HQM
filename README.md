# Requiem-HQM
A minecraft modpack for tutorial / easygoing play

This is a WIP questing pack. It uses the fantastic quests from /u/aaronhowser1 (I have received his permission)
There was a similar pack released recently but did not have all the mods available.
I want this to be a friendly pack to new players and fun for those who enjoy a more relaxed pack.
Ideally I would like to keep the pack as light as possible so you don't need a high spec pc to play it.
Configs are at present standard, some have been altered to stop multiple ores and potion ID fixes.
At present there are 800+ quests. http://imgur.com/a/jBsVK If anyone is interested in helping to test this pack suggest cfg changes etc please let me know.
